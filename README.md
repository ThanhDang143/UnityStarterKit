* Those who want to **master advanced features in 30 minutes**.

## Changelog v0.0.6

* Regardless of fullscreen page or modal/modeless window, they are all considered **Screen**.
* At any given time, **only one Screen is visible** to optimize performance. If a Screen is shown on top of another, the underlying Screen will be temporarily hidden, and it will reappear when the top Screen is closed.
* A Screen is a freeform prefab that does **not require any specific scripts**, allowing it to be used as a child object anywhere.
* A **Scene** is freeform and contains any object, including its own UI canvas. The Sceneâ€™s canvas will not be hidden when a Screen is displayed on top.
* The package size is only 38 KB and does **not depend** on any external libraries.
