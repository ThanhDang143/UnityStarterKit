<h1>Simple Screen Manager for Unity (aka SS)</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>

* Developers looking for a **very simple Screen Manager/Navigator for Unity** with enough features to build any type of game, even mid-core or more complex projects.
* Those who want to **learn the basics in 5 minutes**.
* Those who want to **master advanced features in 15 minutes**.

<h2>Concept</h2>

* Regardless of fullscreen page or modal/modeless window, everything is considered a **Screen**.
* At any given time, **only one Screen is visible** to optimize performance. If a Screen is shown on top of another, the underlying Screen will be temporarily hidden, and it will reappear when the top Screen is closed.
* A Screen is a freeform prefab that does **not require any specific scripts**, allowing it to be used as a child object anywhere.
* A **Scene** is freeform and contains any object, including its own UI canvas. The Sceneâ€™s canvas will not be hidden when a Screen is displayed on top.
