<h1>Simple Screen Manager for Unity (aka SS)</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>

* Developers looking for a **very simple Screen Manager/Navigator for Unity** with enough features to build any type of game, even mid-core or more complex projects.
* Those who want to **learn the basics in 10 minutes**.
* Those who want to **master advanced features in 30 minutes**.

<h2>Concept</h2>

* Regardless of fullscreen page or modal/modeless window, they are all considered **Screen**.
* At any given time, **only one Screen is visible** to optimize performance. If a Screen is shown on top of another, the underlying Screen will be temporarily hidden, and it will reappear when the top Screen is closed.
* A Screen is a freeform prefab that does **not require any specific scripts**, allowing it to be used as a child object anywhere.
* A **Scene** is freeform and contains any object, including its own UI canvas. The Sceneâ€™s canvas will not be hidden when a Screen is displayed on top.
* The package size is only 38 KB and does **not depend** on any external libraries.

```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/load-scene.gif?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h2>Advance Usage</h2>

<h3>1. Addressables</h3>
If you want to use Addressables, you do not need to drag screen prefabs to Resources/Screens

<h4>1.1. Install Addressables package: </h4>

```cs
From Menu: Window / Package Manager / Unity Registry / Addressables / Install
```

<h4>1.2. Add this Scripting Define Symbol: ADDRESSABLE</h4>

```cs
From Menu: Edit / Project Settings / Player / Other Settings / Scripting Define Symbols / + / ADDRESSABLE / Apply
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/addressable-symbol.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h4>1.3. Add screen prefab to addressables groups  </h4>

Make sure the addressable name is the same as the screen name, not a path to the prefab.

</p>

<h3>2. Screen Animations</h3>

<h4>2.1. Default Screen Animations: </h4>

```cs
public enum ScreenAnimation
{
    BottomHide, // The screen slides from the center to the bottom when hiding.
    BottomShow, // The screen slides from the bottom to the center when showing.
    FadeHide,   // The screen fades out when hiding.
    FadeShow,   // The screen fades in when showing.
    LeftHide,   // The screen slides from the center to the left when hiding.
    LeftShow,   // The screen slides from the left to the center when showing.
    RightHide,  // The screen slides from the center to the right when hiding.
    RightShow,  // The screen slides from the right to the center when showing.
    RotateHide, // The screen rotates clockwise when hiding.
    RotateShow, // The screen rotates counterclockwise when showing.
    ScaleHide,  // The screen scales down to 0 when hiding.
    ScaleShow,  // The screen scales up to 1 when showing.
    TopHide,    // The screen slides from the center to the top when hiding.
    TopShow     // The screen slides from the top to the center when showing.
}
```

<h4>2.2. Set Animations when adding screen: </h4>

The screen slides from the left to the center when showing.
```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", showAnimation: ScreenAnimation.LeftShow, hideAnimation: ScreenAnimation.LeftHide, onScreenLoad: (screen) => { });
```

The screen slides from the center to the left when hiding. The 'hideAnimation' which is declared in the Add function will be used
```cs
ScreenManager.Close();
```

The screen fades out when hiding.
```cs
ScreenManager.Close(onScreenClosed: null, hideAnimation: ScreenAnimation.FadeHide);
```

<h4>2.3. Custom Screen Animations: </h4>

Put your custom animations (Unity legacy animations) in Resources/Animations
<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/custom-screen-animations.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

Add screen with custom animations
```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", showAnimation: "Custom1Show", hideAnimation: "Custom1Hide", onScreenLoad: (screen) => { });
```

<h4>2.4. Custom Animation Object: </h4>

In default, animations will be added to the root object of screen

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1");
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/default-animation-object.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

In case you only want to animate a few objects on the screen, the rest are static and not animated

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", animationObjectName: "Animation");
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/custom-animation-object.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h3>3. Events</h3>

<h4>3.1. On Screen Loaded </h4>

Note: onScreenLoaded is called after Awake & OnEnable, before Start of scripts in screen

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", onScreenLoad: (screen) => {
    // screen.Init();
});
```


<h4>3.2. On Scene Loaded </h4>

Note: onSceneLoaded is called after Awake & OnEnable, before Start of scripts in scene

```cs
ScreenManager.Load<Scene1Controller>(sceneName: "Scene1", onSceneLoaded: (scene1) =>
{
    // scene1.Init();
});
```

<h4>3.3. On Screen Added </h4>

Some projects require sending logs for analytics, indicating which screen is added, from which screen, and whether it was added manually (user click) or automatically.

```cs
// On Start of Main
ScreenManager.AddListener(onScreenAdded: (toScreen, fromScreen, manually) => {
    Debug.Log(string.Format("Add screen {0} from screen {1} ") + (manually ? "manually" : "automatically"));
});
ScreenManager.Load<Scene1Controller>(sceneName: "Scene1");
```

```cs
// On Screen1 Button Tap
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", manually:true);
```

```cs
// On Start of Screen1Controller
ScreenManager.Add<Screen2Controller>(screenName: "Screen2", manually:false);
```

Output:
```cs
Added Screen1 from Scene1 manually
Added Screen2 from Screen1 automatically
```


<h4>3.4. On Screen Changed </h4>

Some projects require displaying an ads banner only when no screens are being shown.

```cs
void OnEnable()
{
    ScreenManager.AddListener(OnScreenChanged);
}
```

```cs
void OnDisable()
{
    ScreenManager.RemoveListener(OnScreenChanged);
}
```

```cs
void OnScreenChanged(int screenCount)
{
    if (screenCount > 0)
    {
        // Banner.Hide();
    }
    else
    {
        // Banner.Show();
    }
}
```

<h3>4. Set conditions to display screen</h3>

<h4>4.1. Wait Until No Screen </h4>

In this example, Screen2 will be shown when user closes Screen1, then Screen3 will be shown when user closes Screen2. 

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1");
ScreenManager.Add<Screen2Controller>(screenName: "Screen2",  waitUntilNoScreen: true);
ScreenManager.Add<Screen3Controller>(screenName: "Screen3",  waitUntilNoScreen: true);
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/wait-until-no-screen.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h4>4.2. Custom Add-Condition </h4>

In this example, Screen1 will be shown when the bool something variable becomes true

```cs
bool something = false;
```

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName: "Screen1", addCondition: WaitSomething);
```

```cs
bool WaitSomething()
{
    return something;
}
```

<h4>4.3. Wait until no screen to do other things </h4>

In some cases, you have to wait until there is no more Screen displayed before doing something to avoid being covered by a Screen.

```cs
IEnumerator WaitUntilNoScreenToDoSomething()
{
    while (!ScreenManager.IsNoMoreScreen())
    {
        yield return 0;
    }

    // Do somethings
}
```

<h3>5. Screen Shield</h3>

The Screen shield is an image with customizable color and transparency, located between the current Scene (with its UI canvas) and the top Screen. By default, the Screen shield will be shown when a Screen is displayed.

<h4>5.1. Set Screen Shield Color </h4>

```cs
ScreenManager.Set(screenShieldColor: new Color(0, 0, 0, 0.8f));
```

<h4>5.2. Display a Screen with/without a Shield </h4>

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName:"Screen1");
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/with-shield.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

```cs
ScreenManager.Add<Screen1Controller>(screenName:"Screen1", hasShield: false);
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/without-shield.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h4>5.3. Show/Hide the Screen shield manually (with fade animation) </h4>

```cs
ScreenManager.ShowShield();
```

```cs
ScreenManager.HideShield();
```
