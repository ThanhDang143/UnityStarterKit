<h1>Simple Screen Manager for Unity (aka SS)</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>

* Developers looking for a **very simple Screen Manager/Navigator for Unity** with enough features to build any type of game, even mid-core or more complex projects.
* Those who want to **learn the basics in 10 minutes**.
* Those who want to **master advanced features in 30 minutes**.

<h2>Concept</h2>

* Regardless of fullscreen page or modal/modeless window, everything is considered a **Screen**.
* At any given time, **only one Screen is visible** to optimize performance. If a Screen is shown on top of another, the underlying Screen will be temporarily hidden, and it will reappear when the top Screen is closed.
* A Screen is a freeform prefab that does **not require any specific scripts**, allowing it to be used as a child object anywhere.
* A **Scene** is freeform and contains any object, including its own UI canvas. The Sceneâ€™s canvas will not be hidden when a Screen is displayed on top.

<h2>Advance Usage</h2>

<h3>1. Addressables</h3>
If you want to use Addressables, you do not need to drag screen prefabs to Resources/Screens

<h4>1.1. Install Addressables package: </h4>

```cs
From Menu: Window / Package Manager / Unity Registry / Addressables / Install
```

<h4>1.2. Add this Scripting Define Symbol: ADDRESSABLE</h4>

```cs
From Menu: Edit / Project Settings / Player / Other Settings / Scripting Define Symbols / + / ADDRESSABLE / Apply
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="/learn/unity/ss/advance/addressable-symbol.png?raw=true" alt="Demo">
</p>

<h4>1.3. Add screen prefab to addressables groups  </h4>

Make sure the addressable name is the same as the screen name, not a path to the prefab.
